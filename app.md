# Agents Overview for Heritage Nutrition AI Platform

## Project Context

India’s rich culinary heritage meets rising lifestyle health challenges like diabetes, hypertension, and obesity across diverse family settings. Traditional nutrition advice often misses the mark due to lack of personalization, cultural sensitivity, and complex family dynamics.

This platform aims to bridge that gap by leveraging advanced AI agents that collaboratively deliver personalized, culturally aligned, and practical nutrition guidance — empowering Indian families to eat healthier without sacrificing tradition, flavor, or feasibility.
