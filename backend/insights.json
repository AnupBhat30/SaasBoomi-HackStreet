  "key_insight": "Hello Aaron, your breakfast of poha is a common Indian meal. While it provides carbohydrates for energy, it can be low in protein and fiber, which are important for satiety and muscle maintenance. Considering your age and BMI, focusing on nutrient-dense meals can support your overall health. For the monsoon season, ensuring meals are warming and satisfying is also a good consideration.",
  "modern_approach": "To enhance your energy levels and support your goals, consider incorporating more protein and fiber into your breakfast. As suggested in the posts, a meal with a good balance of macronutrients, like yogurt with fruit and nuts, can be beneficial. Remember that managing caloric intake is key for weight management, as highlighted in the posts.",
  "heritage_alternative": "For a nutritious breakfast, Aaron, try 'Sprouted moong poha'. This heritage alternative offers a good balance of protein and complex carbohydrates. Alternatively, besan ka cheela (gram flour pancake) or sattu parantha (roasted gram flour flatbread) are excellent sources of protein and can be prepared with minimal oil.",
