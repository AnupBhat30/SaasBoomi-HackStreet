  "key_insight": "Hamdan, at 22 with a healthy BMI of 19.6, aims for Weight Loss, Muscle Gain, and Increased Energy. Today's log only shows Dal Makhani for lunch. While lentils provide protein and fiber beneficial for muscle gain and energy, traditional Dal Makhani is often rich in cream and butter, which can be calorie-dense. This could make managing weight loss challenging if not portion-controlled, and the incomplete log means crucial meal opportunities for balanced nutrition were missed.",
  "modern_approach": "To support your goals, integrate simple, protein-rich options focusing on lean mass gain and fat loss. As a student with moderate stress, consider quick, budget-friendly choices like grilled paneer or chicken with a vibrant vegetable salad (like with available capsicum) for lunch or dinner. Prioritize whole foods for sustained energy.",
  "heritage_alternative": "Leverage traditional Indian foods to meet your goals effectively. Opt for lighter lentil preparations such as Moong Dal or Masoor Dal, cooked with minimal oil and a good amount of seasonal vegetables like bhindi, as an alternative to calorie-dense curries. This aligns with promoting healthy, low-calorie Indian dishes rich in fiber and nutrients.",
