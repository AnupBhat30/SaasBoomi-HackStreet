  "key_insight": "Your current meal log includes poha, light dal, and soft sabzi, which are generally good choices for managing hypertension and arthritis. The inclusion of buttermilk and roasted chana as snacks is also positive. However, for your goals of maintaining mobility and managing blood pressure, focusing on increasing protein intake and ensuring adequate fiber is important. Given your BMI of 26, a balanced approach with nutrient-dense foods will support your health.",
  "modern_approach": "To address your goals of maintaining mobility and managing blood pressure, consider incorporating a small serving of protein-rich foods like Greek yogurt or cottage cheese with your breakfast. Post-001 suggests that increasing protein intake is crucial, especially for vegetarians, and can be achieved through options like tofu or tempeh if you find traditional sources insufficient.",
  "heritage_alternative": "For breakfast, 'Sprouted moong poha' is a great heritage alternative to regular poha, offering more protein and fiber, which is beneficial for managing blood pressure and supporting mobility. You can also explore other nutrient-dense options like 'Ragi porridge' which is readily available in your location.",
