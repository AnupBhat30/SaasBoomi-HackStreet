    "post_title": "Does an Indian urban diet condemn you to diabetes?",
    "post_description": "please note that I am NOT generalizing all Indians, but specifically an urban middle class lifestyle - i.e you are mostly sedentary, you have enough money to not worry about food and can afford to eat snacks etc. Unlike the poor in the West, who eat junk food and grow fat, the poor in India eat mostly home cooked food but are obviously struggling and no one is fat.\n\nIndia is the diabetes capital of the world, and a huge portion of the urban population is probably prediabetic. Obesity is obviously a huge problem that is closely linked.\n\nI don't think an Indian diet is unhealthy - far from it, I think its one of the best. I'm talking about a traditional Indian vegetarian diet - full of veggies, dal, spices.\n\nAlmost every single meal, every snack, is full of carbs - whether its South or North or Central Indian food. All the parathas, rotis, idli, dosas, the snacks which are 99% deep fried carb and potatoes, and the sweets which are very high in sugar.\n\nCarbs by themselves aren't bad - they are a staple food and the low carb movement is just a fad diet to promote meat and fat and very hard for vegetarians. But the reality is almost everyone in India in that demo eats a calorie surplus. And there is a genetic predisposition in Indians to gain weight and be affected more.\n\nAll those carbs and calories leads to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, obesity, prediabetes and eventually Type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe only solution is to eat less (to maintain your weight) and to lose weight. Most of the advice will tell people to eat Western foods like oats and egg white omelets or ragi roti, or start a low carb diet and take all kinds of supplements. I don't believe this is how we should eat.\n\nIn summary, change your diet completely. Stop eating all the snacks like samosa and chat and street food. This is not feasible at all for most people. And its not cheap either.\n\nI don't know what the solution is but its very worrying.",

But in today's time when at least 12 hours a day we are just sitting ( office home wherever) the same amount of food intake will lead to lifetsyle disorder ( Diabetes,  Hypertension and more) \n\nSimilarly because of the way we are spread now, we have also forgotten why each region of India has a specific food item which is staple.. the rice based foods in southern parts of india are suited to the more tropical weather but if you eat Parathas in Pune and Mumbai, god bless your immune system and body.\n\nThe original Indian foods and recipes were suited to the region and weather and contained balance of anti oxidants and other basic necessities to maintain a healthy gut and body..\n\nAlso, In our earlier lifestyles, fasting was an inherent part of lifestyle( disguised as Rituals) but today we eat 5 times a day so if we abuse the food we eat, what else we can expect!",

You can literally eat the same meal, but with less roti/dosa/rice and more of the vegetable or daal. Deep fried food is absolutely not some essential part of Indian cuisine. You can skip the chaat or eat soya chaap at street food vendors instead for protein.\n\nIn my experience the default diet if you mainly eat out even in the US will be pretty bad for you. You have to focus on a few good places or meals that are healthy, or start eating the majority of meals at home. I have lived in both places. In Canada where I live now, I have to basically cook most meals myself to have a healthy diet. It takes some time and energy. If I wanted to eat healthier in India, i would find it easier in a sense because you have domestic help to help you cook.\n\nThe solution of changing your diet is not as scary or difficult as it sounds, just take it step by step :) I started the same way and told myself it would take a year to change my eating habits and just went slowly. It did take a year of small changes adding up but now my diet is healthy and I'm just very aware of what I eat and how it could be tweaked to be healthier when I eat it. It doesnt feel like I'm making some huge sacrifice, I still enjoy my food and eat out plenty as well.\n\nIf you have trouble hitting protein macros protein powder is an easy and safe option.",

Indians also consume excess amounts of cereals and not enough proteins, fruits, and vegetables. “\n\nWe eat too many carbs and not enough protein that is the heart of the issue. I feel Indian diet is not bad per se, it is just our chosen proportions of the different foods which is the issue. It’s hard to change especially when people feel they are eating healthy ie. “I’m just eating subji roti and some fruit”. If the Sabji is potato which you eating with roti and then eating a very sweet fruit (ie sweet grapes) then it’s not healthy because you ate too much carbs/sugar.\n\nJust to add I’m almost 40 and I believed for the longest time our traditional diet was healthy. Normal was two vegetables with a roti, breakfast and lunch were more western but mostly cereal based. I remember even as a teenager the feeling of “running out of energy” and “I need to eat something now” Now I recognise that despite everything home cooked I was unable to efficiently regulate my blood sugar and it is not normal to feel like this. I do eat meat so have switched to a meat/eggs/nuts/vege diet for the last two years (lower carb not strict low carb) . I don’t necessarily try to cut calories, I just eat till I’m full. The difference is night and day I no longer feel like this and my prediabetes also reversed. I lost more than 20 pounds and most of it was from my mid section so I no longer have the stereotypical post marriage/baby body. But it seems at least for my body a lower carb diet is what has seemed to work and I can’t go back to strict Indian proportions of carbs. Don’t know if it works for anyone else and also believe it’s possible to accomplish on a vege diet if careful.",

Other options are Matta Rice (high grown is better - look out for the one grown in the nilgiris, or Sri Lankan highlands)\n\nAlso, any cooked rice if refrigerated for 16 hrs,  sheds its glycemic load by a significant margin. The underlying concept is applicable to any starchy food but easy peasy with rice. Just make sure you handle it hygienically if using over multiple days.\n\nAnother trick to lower the glycemic load of anything is to balance it with healthy fat - like grass - fed butter and ghee,  100% avocado oil mayonnaise, whole free range eggs.  So a spoonful of grass-fed ghee in your dal/sabji and even roti will help a lot. \n\nAvoid fruit juices and over-ripe fruits. consume fruits before they are fully ripe.\n\nSwap potatoes with sweet potato. Even if you have to use potatoes, boil and refrigerate.\n\nInstead of wheat, you can use jowar, bajra and chickpeas (black desi chana) flour to make rotis. Play around with the ratio based on weather and mood.\n\nWhole bunch of other ideas to share but I hope you get them from others as well.",

        "text": "Controlling blood sugar is not so much about controlling carbs but about controlling how rapidly and slowly the sugars (glucose) are released into the bloodstream. This is where \"glycemic index\" and glycemic load comes into the picture. What it literally means is an index number that indicates how slowly glucose is released into the bloodstream. Foods with [low GI](http://www.mendosa.com/gi.htm) are highly preferred and they will invariable include unprocessed unskinned [unpolished foods](https://www.livestrong.com/article/425633-the-glycemic-index-for-raspberries/) - aka complex carbs.\n\nThis means brown rice, whole lentils instead of split, whole chickpeas and kidney beans, most vegetables like beans, cauliflower, cabbage, especially leafy greens like spinach, methi, moringa leaves (aka murungakkai leaves or drumstick leaves), drumsticks, gourds, squashes, etc. Also for breakfast, it would be good to find substitutes for rice - for example oats idly or rawa idly would be better. Or reducing the rice ratio quantity in idly, dosa etc. and increasing the lentil quantity. Pesaratu and adai are great low GI options. Most whole fruits like organges, apples, pears, banana, berries are actually quite good too - just avoid fruit juices. Nuts are great too. Even honey is half decent, at least compared to sugar - although obviously in reduced quantities. Avoid artificial sweeteners.\n\nAnother very effective way to eat low GI is to eat food that is high in protein and high in fats. Indians have this notion that \"healthy eating\" means reducing oil. Truth is, healthy eating is more about eating lower amount of carbs and sugars. Oils and fats are really not that harmful - a lot of new research is also backing this up. Especially fats like ghee and paneer and milk give a feeling of fullness, and that feeling lasts a fairly long time, and it contributes almost nothing to blood sugar. Whole wheat rotis are decent too. Or even better, whole wheat mixed with [varagu (millets), green gram, and bajra](http://apjcn.nhri.org.tw/server/apjcn/2/3/111.htm). Aashirvad sells this premixed flour nowadays. Ragi has surprisingly high GI so should be avoided.\n\nThe second most important thing besides consuming low GI food is to stop this nasty habit we have of eating few giant meals. That spikes our blood sugar and then the sugar level plummets, causing us to feel weak and jittery and light-headed. By the way, for diabetics, low blood sugar is far worse than high blood sugar - and paradoxically, people who have high blood sugar are far more prone to sugar crashes. In extreme cases, they can faint and have to go to the emergency room.\n\nSo the hardest but also most effective thing to change is the way we eat meals. Replace the 2-3 giant meals with 5-6 smaller meals - eat a small low GI meal every 3-4 hours (4 hours being the outer thereshold). This will be the thing your father will resist the most as it involves a change in habit of how we eat. But trust me, it will be well worth it. Destroy the concept of lunches and dinners - make it a meal that has to be eaten more regularly. In fact, truth be told, with smaller more frequent meals, you can even get away with eating somewhat high GI food (at least once in a while) simply because you are still not causing so much of a sugar spike and drop.",

Not eating fruits with high GI - Example: Watermelon, Banana (especially ripped), Mangoes, etc. Basically all the super sweet fruits.\n5.

Here's the Joslin Diabetes Center on the subject:\n\n>We know now that it is okay for people with diabetes to substitute sugar-containing food for other carbohydrates as part of a balanced meal plan. Prevailing beliefs up to the mid-1990s were that people with diabetes should avoid foods that contain so-called \"simple\" sugars and replace them with \"complex\" carbohydrates, such as those found in potatoes and cereals. A review of the research at that time revealed that there was relatively little scientific evidence to support the theory that simple sugars are more rapidly digested and absorbed than starches, and therefore more apt to produce high blood glucose levels.\n\n[link](https://www.joslin.org/info/the_truth_about_the_so-called_diabetes_diet.html)\n\n[Here's an excellent big study on glycemic index](https://academic.oup.com/ajcn/article/89/1/97/4598292)\n\nWhole grain breads spike blood sugar almost exactly as high as do fruit and soft drinks. The difference between whole grain breads and white breads is indistinguishable. (Potatoes and pasta are the worst)\n\nMoreoever the differences between low GI and high GI are sometimes almost nil. High GI and Low GI breads are almost indistinguishable. From the conclusion:\n\n>The message to eat whole grains can result in the intake of carbohydrates with a GI no different from that in response to the consumption of white bread\n\nI will admit that there was one surprise for me - legumes rank much lower than all of the other carby foods they tested.

It was very difficult switching them to low carb, high protein - high fibre diet. Now they eat sattu(homemade with millets), chapati, increased vegetables, saag/bhaaji, and have cut down heavily on polished rice, sweet fruits and goat meat (mostly eat fish or eggs 1-2 times a week). \n\nEg, for lunch I told them to include some carbs because the sugar lowering effect of medicine taken in the morning peaks around noon-afternoon. They eat about a cup of rice OR few chapatis and rest is just desi salad(kheera/kakdi), daal, saag, 2-3 different vegetables either cooked together or separate curries/dry. I would say Rice/roti is about 20-25% of lunch.\n\nDad(>8 years) has transitioned well into the new diet, mom(pre-diabetic) is still adjusting with occasional digestive issues or low/high blood sugar once in a while. Mom's diet is still being adjusted with adding/removing certain foods. \n\nThere's things like variety, age, level of processing of rice, wheat, etc that also affects how it will be digested in body. I won't go into all that as my reply is already too lengthy. Look it up or ask around. \n\nFinally, I would like to add that each person is unique with different co-morbid issues, stress levels, etc and different response profile to different types of food, medicine, age, BMI, etc etc. So the medical therapy, lifestyle & diet all have to be tailored considering as much factors as possible.

Vitamin B is not even talked about. Anemia is shrugged off as a common but minor problem.\n\nI have seen 2 children who are stunted because their mothers were strict vegetarians and won't give their kids eggs (or packaged baby food) even when the doctors, their spouses, etc. insisted they do so. They continued feeding their picky kids bland khichadi or upma EVERY F-INK DAY. Of course the kids appetite reduced, of course they didn't eat it. Doesn't matter how many vegetables you add to it or how many hours you spent making-feeding it, or how nutritious it is supposed to be.

These new trends of ancient grains, village food, local food, etc. is only making their beliefs stronger. The problem isn't evident because the kids are small, but I won't be surprised if there is a sudden increase in stunting/IQ in urban areas.

I made Shahi Paneer according to [this recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ngIuOihdD9k&t=19s), it was the best curry i've made so far, but I think this is due to increasing experience (as I am 0.000% Indian, I am starting from scratch) . But, I think I prefer curries with more volume, like the ones from the restaurant.  Another difference is, my curry is much less calorie dense. The same volume of curry, will not last as long. \n\nThe issue being, the primary body of the curry has very few calories.\n\n>  383G tomato's, > 250G ONION \n\nBesides cream, not much else adds calories.\n\nI've heard that you can over season it, thin it out with water, than add a puree of yogurt and chikpeas to add calories? Thoughts?\n\nedit: A lot of my comments seem to be downvoted. I will clarify here\n\n1. I wanted my **gravy** to last longer\n\n2. I'm not a huge protein obsessed person. Tofu isn't super filling for me, and paneer is good but I need... more gravy... for the paneer, right? Pretty simple I think.\n\n3. I'm not afraid of eating more fact, in fact, I need more of it. I am at risk of diabetes due to my carb-focused diet (being Italian), so I would prefer to have both. \n\nThank you for all your replies, btw.",

Skip the hand blender at the end of the recipie.

Mix any left over sabjis, with hummus or Greek yoghurt and grill it. I also chop and bake a big batch of veggies over weekend and use it in my meals throughout the day.\n\nAsk your mom to mix almond flour, ragi or black Chana flour in wheat flour to make any home cooked Rotis and paratha more healthy. \n\nEvening: green yoghurt with fruits or some boiled eggs. \n\nDinner: lentils, sprouted lentils if possible.

No logic. Just a thought- Let them enjoy the food they like. Try minimizing the portion, but don't fall for those 'marketed claimed healthy' products like makhana. The quality of oil and amount of salt these healthy packages have is really unhealthy than a mathri from a local shop which sells in tons on a monthly basis, It is fried yet not that unhealthy as these local shops can't have enough of stale / reused oil in comparison to a small market of healthy makhanas brand. So, pick up a local shop and buy small portions of namkeen. Let them enjoy their life. Make sure they go for a walk and you spend quality time with them. That's all they need! No offence, pls!",

Plus include plenty of them in my meals and snacks. One of my favourite snacks was something like a raita bowl - yoghurt with coriander and a pinch of salt, some raw veggies like cucumbers, carrots, onions, and tomatoes, and some pickle.  You can do a chaat bowl also but cut down on the carbs and tamarind chutney (lots of sugar). \n\nFor protein, a lot of grilled and baked things, like fish and prawns. Tandoori style is always good. Although, I think your usual curry will be fine, as long as it’s not loaded with fat. \n\nAlso, I didn’t eliminate carbs, but I did cut back a bit.  Sometimes if I had had my carbs quota prior to dinner, I did a pulao out of cauliflower - you basically grind cauliflower until it’s a consistency similar to rice. I don’t like it plain, but if you do a tadka (I usually did mine with jeera, onion, and garlic), you don’t have that raw cauliflower taste.  You can do it in a fried rice style also.  Millets are also a great option - complex carbs and highly nutritious. You can use the whole grains in place of rice. Their flours are also better than the usual stuff for things like roti, dosa etc.\n\nFor breakfast, I oftentimes just do scrambled or boiled eggs with some whole grain toast. You can desi-fly it with onions, tomatoes, coriander, and chili. \n\nFinally, pay attention to water and fibre.",

This is not sustainable at all, you will regain glycogen/water as soon as you resume a normal diet.\n\nIndian diet is actually very healthy. Modern urban Indian diet with 90% of snacks being deep fried carbs, eating 5-6x/day, and very litle activity, is the problem - which is the same as all other urban socities. Additional issues are a genetic tendency to store visceral fat and lower sensitivity in south asians. \n\nthere are so many ways in an Indian diet to eat more vegetables, spices, herbs with healthy carbs for very little calories. we should be promoting that instead of advising people to eat oatmeal, eggs, animal protein etc.",

Eating two tablespoons (30mL) of sunflower oil a day will not hurt, only eating food deep fried in any vegetable oil will definitely be harmful.  \n(c) The problem here isn't vegetable oils, the problem here is the ratio of omega-6:omega-3 unsaturated fatty acids. This ratio should be at least 4:1, possibly even 1:1 . Omega-3 rich oils are best eaten without heating, and they have a strong flavour (like extra virgin olive oil, walnut oil, mustard oil, ...)  \n(d) Fatty fish are extremely good sources of omega-3s. The western recommendation is salmon, but fatty fish twice a week will be fine.  \n(e) Vegetarian sources of omega-3 in India are mustard oil, and walnuts. If you are a vegetarian, cook one meal with sunflower oil and one meal with mustard oil.  \n(f) The nutritional guidelines for India are available at https://www.nin.res.in/downloads/DietaryGuidelinesforNINwebsite.pdf  \n\nYou may be better off watching your macros rather than worrying about individual nutrients. Refined cereals (maida, white rice), simple starches/sugars (potatoes, fruit juices, soft drinks,, etc) and excess salt are way more harmful than vegetable oils.\n\nSufficient calories, a wide variety of vegetables, fruits, complex carbohydrates, proteins, and an appropriate ratio of omega-3:omega-6 are probably the main things you should focus on for a good diet. The other component here is to be physically active (lots of cardio, some strength, some balance).",

The ones that have the MOST amount of MUFA and PUFA, and the LEAST amount of Saturated Fats are healthier. Also be careful to avoid any oils that have trans-fats in them as trans-fats are bad even in trace quantities. Canola oil is notorious for it even tho it's marketed as healthy because of low sat-fats. I'd also go for the cold pressed oils over refined oils because the cold pressing preserves some of the vitamins and micronutrients in the oils. The rest is a matter of taste.\n\nGhee is very high in saturated fats, but the sheer aroma of food made in ghee is mesmerizing. Samosa fried in ghee vs in oil, world of difference in aroma. However, for this same reason, it's unique aroma, it's not recommended to cook everything in it because it will impart it's own taste and aroma to the food which doesn't sit well with all foods.\n\nHealth-wise, someone has misinformed you on Sunflower oil. I have a relative who has suffered a heart attack and another who has gout, and they were both told by their doctors to prefer sunflower oil. It also has an advantage of being a relatively neutral tasting oil, unlike groundnut, sesame, mustard, coconut, etc oils, that have a unique taste associated with them.\n\nAs for your last query, yes, traditionally, different indian cuisines use different oils, or to put it more accurately certain traditional dishes are better tasting in specific oils. For example, Gujarati Undhyu and Farsan in groundnut oil. South Indian foods in coconut oil. Punjabi Sarson Da Saag in Mustard oil, etc. However, a neutral oil will still make indian food taste pretty good. Indian food is very versatile that way.",

Since the time I was diagnosed i have changed my diet to a less spicy and high fibre diet which has helped me greatly. Home made food which I used to be made with green chillies and spices were now made with no green chillies and minimum spices keeping the taste intact.\n\n\n\nI would like to replicate this type of cooking for public consumption. This will be normal homemade type food but with minimum spice level.\n\n\nIs this a feasible idea to even think of?",

We've been trying to cook healthier Indian meals for our family, but we're putting in a lot of work to learn about and find proper ingredients and techniques.\n\nI realize that not everyone can put in the time and effort to this, and I'm starting a project to understand the challenges people have incorporating healthy eating habits into their love for Indian cuisine. By sharing your thoughts, you can help us come up with solutions that respect our rich culinary heritage while keeping it nutritious.\n\nIf you have a few minutes, we’d love for you to take this quick survey and share your approach to making Indian food healthier. Every insight helps! And if you have feedback on the survey, please let me know!\n\n[Healthy Indian Foods Survey](https://forms.gle/iycWQeoLRZcGsdai6)",

Although the food here is very delicious, the restaurant style food is quite heavy - eating out 2/3 times a day is taking a toll. I think the main issue is the amount of ghee, which my body isn't used to.\n\nI've searched on this sub and can see that the topic of healthy food comes up a lot, but most commenters say you should just eat home-style Indian cooking, not restaurant style. \n\nAs I'm staying in hotels I have no way to cook - so what are some of the healthier options I can choose in restaurants?\n\nAlso, is it possible for me to ask for less ghee in my food when I order? Would it be considered insulting to ask? I have already noticed that roti sometimes comes with ghee even if I ordered a plain roti.\n\nI thoroughly enjoy both veg and non veg dishes, and my main goals are keeping the ghee content down and the protein and fibre up.",

It’s called differently in different regions, but the basic idea is that it’s available at places of worship and offered to visitors as a blessing. \n\nThe food is typically simple and many a times serves fresh local ingredients because the ingredients might’ve been donated to the place of worship. Other times, especially for festivals, the recipes and ingredients follow strict dietary guidelines since it is associated with a religious ritual. \n\nGurudwara (a Sikh place of worship) is a prime example of this. Meals are served to devotees every day, free of charge. Similarly the Hare Krishna movement offers similar nourishment to their disciples. I understand similar temple kitchens can be found in South India as well. \n\nThese meals are offered to the religious devotees visiting the place of worship. Since you’d be visiting these places of worship, encourage reading up about that particular religion and learn the customs. \n\nLike at a Sikh Gurudwara, you’d likely sit on the floor, expected to finish everything on your plate (ask for less quantity to begin with and go for second to avoid wasting food), and be expected to bus your utensils etc at the end of the meal. \n\nThese are simple things, but worth learning to be respectful to the community. Be mindful that it all costs money, so consider donating if you can. There are plenty of donation drop boxes at such institutions. \n\nFinally, if you’re visiting such places, besides a healthy meal, you’ll also learn about the culture at a deeper level.

But combine that with a bowl of lentil curry or sambar and you're getting a lot of volume/calories with enough protein for the average individual. The trick is to understand that dosa/poha/other carbs are just vessels for the remaining foods, not the mains. If you don't feel satiated after eating three idlies and a bowl of curry (~300 calories), have a bowl of veggies to fill up your stomach -- don't reach for an extra idly. Side note: amongst common carb sources, Idlies are probably the best bang for your buck (calories/macros) and you could easily accommodate them in most diets.\n\nIf you're to lose weight while gaining muscle, upping your protein intake through supplements is the easiest shout for vegetarians. If Whey powder is out of your budget, try using skimmed milk powder.\n\nP.S: I found the best way to guarantee weight loss is to track your food on apps like MyFitnessPal, HealthifyMe, Cronometer.

        "text": "> The OP asked for a Healthy Indian Breakfast ideas and in my original comment I have clearly mentioned even the food OP mentioned as unhealthy are healthy and could be taken in low quantities.\n\nYou didn't read OP's post closely enough. Their very first line was:\n\n> I'm trying to lose weight and I realised that whatever food is cooked at home for breakfast is mostly carbohydrate and very high calorie.\n\nAnd your reply:\n\n> I still do consider the food items I suggested are healthy and should be taken in smaller quantities than usual to reduce weight.\n\nOP specifically asked for low carb Indian breakfast. And you continued suggesting the same high carb breakfast items and then ask OP to do portion control. If OP wanted to do that, they wouldn't even have bothered posting\n\n> If by some standard, these foods are deemed not healthy, then in my opinion, that standard was popularized by someone who wants to sell something or the alternatives they suggest are good for short term results.\n\nYes, by the standards of being high carb and consequently high sugar. Different people have different health goals. \"Healthy\" is not some magical one size fits all answer. If you're diabetic or have high blood sugar (pre-diabetic) or are overweight and want to lose weight, your key priority is to reduce and manage carb (aka sugar) consumption. The things you suggested: pongal, puttu, upma, ragi porridge, and oats are all almost entirely pure carbs. Besides oats, they are even worse - they are very high in glycemic index which means they get digested very quickly by your body (probably in an hour or so), release all their sugars in a big dump in your bloodstream which causes your sugar level to spike, and then shortly after the sugar level crashes. This sugar yo-yo or sine wave pattern is absolutely brutal on your body even for a healthy person, and even worse for a pre-diabetic or diabetic.\n\nAnd worst of all, when the sugar crashes, you get low blood sugar which is fairly dangerous as it can sometimes cause dizziness and light headedness and you can literally faint. Or even otherwise, it will cause you to feel weak and jittery and fluttery in a couple of hours and you get massive hunger pangs. So you end up eating something else that is high GI (or worse you will do hunger snacking on junk food) and the cycle will continue every few hours.\n\nFor the record, this notion of \"fats are bad\" was also perpetuated and heavily marketed by the American sugar lobby who actively lobbied and bribed policy makers and even researchers in big universities to shift the blame from sugar to fat. Their strategy was to make fat/oil the villain and the world ended up with \"low fat, high sugar\" versions of everything including dietary recommendations. Current research shows the exact opposite is true. \n\nI am not making this up and this is not some conspiracy or fad stuff. Please read up by yourself. I'm not trying to convince you - just present the facts.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/society/2016/sep/12/sugar-industry-paid-research-heart-disease-jama-report\n\nhttps://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493739074/50-years-ago-sugar-industry-quietly-paid-scientists-to-point-blame-at-fat\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/the-sugar-lobbys-sour-tactics/2015/04/10/9fb5b78a-dfa7-11e4-a1b8-2ed88bc190d2_story.html\n\nAll these are very reputable publishing sources. See this excerpt from Washington Post:\n\n> Consider the 2015 Agriculture Department dietary guidelines now being prepared by the Obama administration. A scientific advisory committee is recommending Americans hold calories from added sugars to 10 percent of their diets, because: “strong and consistent evidence” shows they are “associated with excess body weight”; “strong evidence shows” they increase the risk of Type 2 diabetes; “moderate evidence” shows sugars are “consistently associated with increased risk of hypertension, stroke and CHD [coronary heart disease]”; and “moderate consistent evidence” links cavities to sugar intake.\n\nHere's the interesting thing: They are not just associating sugar consumption with diabetes and body weight, they are also associating it with hypertension and heart disease - both diseases and ailments that we hold \"fats\" and oils to be the sole culprit. And also worth noting that carbs are the exact same thing as sugar. They get metabolized by your body into sugar and get released into your bloodstream as sugar/glucose.",

I have had very unhealthy junk food and snacking habits for the majority of my life. \n\nI definitely get your idea, though. Too add onn for the information of other who might be reading this, your calories need not be limited daily. As long as your under your set calorie limit weekly, you can also be flexible in how to spread them out across the week. \n\nEg, If you aim to consume 1500 calories a day, think of it as a money. \n\nPer week week you have 1500 * 7  =10500 calories to \"spend\"\n\nYou might go out on the weekends, or have a small party or something. In which case, you can keep your weekend caloric budget higher, at, say, 2000. That leaves you 6500 calories for the rest of the week, during which you can consume 1300 daily.",

Suggest me some food that are rich in carbs\", and then if you know oils are healthier than carbs for people with sedentary lifestyle, I would want you to let me know that you think that (preferably supported by evidence since I still think it is a terrible idea)\n\nI did the same thing.  I thought eating in lower portions of any healthy food you already like that might help OP in the long term for weight loss rather than ditching your regular food just because it is wrong by any standard.  For example, if you take coconut oil, which is considered unhealthy for heart by nutrition experts. https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/282857. \n\nHowever if you are from Kerala already using coconut oil since childhood and suddenly stop it, your heart won't get healthy overnight or in a few months or years.  Your body would have already become used to it, but for someone who was brought up without consuming saturated fat in such high quantities, this will be a definite problem.\n\nThere are around 111 replies on this post and let us take something I found different was banana with yoghurt.  On paper, these are things available in India, and it is possible to take this for the rest of your life to reduce and maintain a low body weight.  But anyone who reaches their target bodyweight will again resort to their older food habits.  I say this as a person who has been a roommate with a receptionist at a gym.  From his experience around 30% of those who pay come regularly and only 5 to 10% of them they reach their target weight.  It is interesting what they do after that though - while they come regularly, they simply discontinue their diet plan (which usually includes non-staple food) and get out of shape in less than a month or so.\n\nAs for portion control, I have practically seen colleagues around me losing weight simply by portion control.  To be specific what I've seen is a colleague who takes 6 idlis take 5 idlis (if dosas 2 instead of 3) in the morning and eats less portion of rice both at lunch and dinner reduce his weight by around 6 kgs in 7 months (not something recommendable since people want things faster) but he did not gain after that, he didn't feel hungry in between meals (initially he used to).\n\nI have my own doubts regarding oats (due to their aggressive marketing), but that something often suggested as part of the diet plan by the dietician that works at the gym for taking care of that hunger that comes between meals and it seems to work for the 10% who attend regularly.\n\nMy suspicion is that high carb being reason for weight gain must be studied where the sample abroad or if it is done in India it is not done properly.  I have seen a lot of other Indians (my own colleagues, relatives) who are not obese eating more than 7 idlis for breakfast, and a lot of rice for lunch and dinner - especially in the southern states of India where rice is the staple food.\n\nThis is a link about high carbs : https://health.clevelandclinic.org/good-carb-bad-carb-dont-buy-into-4-myths/\nwhich includes rice as high carb (interestingly it says whole grains such as ragi should not be considered bad) and should be avoided by some experts not from India where the staple food is rice.",

All they will see is a “red sauce”.\n\nAnother way is to make use of natural flavourings and “extracted” into your dishes with proper technique. For example, carrot has great natural sweetness, but the best way to extract it is to cook it slowly over low heat (think stews, slow oven roasts, etc).

I am working on fixing these things now.   \nI have worked out almost all issues with my lifestyle (I am getting more active and working to meet daily workout and steps goals) and with food I am cutting out all junk food and sugary drinks. But here is an issue I am still facing:  \nI tend to cook good indian meals, I make chicken and veggie curries and different types of dal and sambar etc. These are also generally healthy, I use very minimal oil, and dont add any cream (I am south Indian, and the most I might add is some yogurt to thicken the gravy). I am sure that these curries are reasonably healthy in terms of calories and sugar content. My main issue is rice. Its the one thing I am struggling to cut down in quantity. I am not sure what to do, so if you have any suggestions at all (low calorie rice alternatives that go well with Indian food, or anything else at all that has worked for you) please let me know. ",

One of the things I really loved was cauliflower rice - it has a weird taste on its own, but if you do the usual South Indian tempering (asofetida and curry leaves are key) and add some onions and garlic, it tastes really nice.  I usually just did a pulao because I was eating it with curries like you, but I also occasionally did tomato or lemon rice. Not the same exactly, but it often did hit the spot.\n\nI was also part of a larger group coaching with others, and many group members experimented a lot with millets. Mixed rice with millets, even biryani with millets.  A lot of them also did millet dosas and idlis. There are a few places (mainly in NJ I think) that ship millets nationwide. \n\nThe other thing I learned to do is just eat my meals with smaller amounts of rice, or no rice at all. On days where I felt like something light, I just had rasam with some ghee and a poriyal. You do eventually get used to it.

Long grain rice apparently also causes slower glucose spikes than short grain rice.\n\nThere's also a thing called \"resistant starch.\" It's just a change in the structure of the starch so it \"resists digestion.\" This means it digests more slowly (so less glucose spike). Also, some of the starch makes it to the colon and feeds the gut microbiome.\n\nOne way to increase resistant starch in rice is to cook and cool it before eating. So for example curd rice would be an example of this. I tend to make a big batch of rice and freeze the leftovers. I know when I talk about reheating rice, someone always wants to tell me about food poisoning so look here are guidelines on safely reheating leftover rice: https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/322775#prepare-store-and-reheat\n\nAs a side note, here's another way to increase resistant starch that you're probably already familiar with: while cooking some dal or Rajma or other beans, smash a few against the side. Then allow the sauce to thicken/\"gelatinize.\" If you also cool the leftovers and eat them later, then you get even more resistant starch.",

        "text": "There is this persistent myth among Indians that fat is the true villain and the knee jerk reaction of EVERY diet seems to be \"reduce oil and ghee\" and torture yourself. And that self-torture is made out to be a virtuous pain and the notion is that the pain will heal you.\n\nIn your case, you goals are very specific - you want to eat a more diabetic friendly diet. So let's get the main myth out of the way. Oil, fats, cream - none of that causes an insulin response. They simply don't - or the amount they affect your blood sugar is negligible. So PLEASE stop focusing on the amount of fats you consume.\n\nSecond biggest myth is that calories are related to blood sugar. Again, there is NO correlation.\n\nWhat you're trying to manage is your blood sugar level. Your body converts carbs into sugar and that sugar causes a spike in blood sugar levels. So what you need to control is:\n\n1. The amount of direct and indirect sugar you're consuming. Direct sugar comes from sugar, refined and processed foods, fruit juice etc. Indirect sugar comes from carbs which get broken down into sugars in your body.\n\n2. The rate at which foods get converted into sugar. This is GI or Glycemic Index of foods. So you can still eat carbs for example, but if you eat foods with low GI, it releases its sugar slowly into your bloodstream which causes a gradual increase in blood sugar which the body can handle much better. As opposed to sugar and processed foods that dump all their sugar into the bloodstream causing a massive spike in bood sugar resulting in yo-yo blood sugar levels where blood sugar spikes suddenly and then crashes suddenly (even worse)\n\nFats actually get absorbed really really slowly, if at all, and have nothing to do with blood sugar. In fact, ADDING fats to your diet is VERY healthy for most diabetics as it fills you up, prevents you from eating carbs and sugar to feel full, and doesn't cause the blood sugar spike that carbs and sugar does. And contrary to popular belief, fat doesn't make you fat. Again, carbs and sugars make you fat. So it is actually a double benefit.\n\nWhat you want to do is to reduce your carb consumption in the form of grains like rice. AND you want to switch to a low GI variant. Simple thumb rule is - the more rustic and unrefined your food is, the lower its GI and the \"healthier\" it is for you. Switching to brown rice is a simple first step in this direction. Another simple step is to reduce the quantity of rice and eat more curry and veggies and chicken instead. And if you make your curries richer by adding MORE fat, it will be MUCH easier for you to reduce your rice quantity.",

So I had a lot of surface crystallisation when I made the smaller test batch. \n\n",

I want it to be soft and have a buttery creamy texture, how can I achieve this? \n\nMy recipe: \nI melt around 200g of butter in a pan over a low/medium heat before adding in a mug full of coarse semolina. I roast this over the medium low heat for about 10 mins stirring constantly, I then add in about half a mug of sugar and mix that in quickly followed by a whole 410ml tin of evaporated milk and about 150ml whole milk. I sometimes flavour with some vanilla, cardamom and saffron. I keep stirring until it’s thickened enough and sort of comes away from the pan when I’m mixing and at this point it’s done. \n\nDo I need to switch to fine semolina? Use more milk? \n\nThanks in advance! ",

The problem I’m facing: I get so happy when I see a label with something like 2-3g sugar per 100mL but then I taste it and it’s sweet as hell due to artificial sweeteners.\n\nI’m not after a beverage that tastes sweet without sugar, I’m looking for something that just isn’t very sweet because I really don’t enjoy sweet tasting drinks.\n\nSo far, kombucha has proven to be the only option but it’s expensive as hell, 150rs or so per bottle. What I end up doing as of now is to purchase a sweet drink like juice or iced tea and dilute it at home with club soda, water, or tonic water, then drink it. This isn’t a bad option for me and it’s working fine but I would love to know if you guys have any suggestions!",

You add only 5 ml, then add some salt and lemon. Very often it tastes better or not worse than 10 ml.\n\n\n2. Buying concentrates is much much cheaper than buying full drinks because transporting water costs a lot as it weighs 95% of the product. And it targets lazy people, or traveling people, both of which don't mind paying much more for the drink. \n\n\n3. Make your own kombucha - it is dead simple once you get the process down. You can start bottling too if you just want to open and drink occasionally. Other options are iced tea, water kefir.\n\n\n4. Fundamentally drinking your calories is a bad idea. So if you are reaching out for drinks often, even with low sugar and some nutrients, eating is much better than drinking. Because it engages much more of your body : mouth, teeth, jaw, swallowing : which gives more overall satisfaction. Our bodies are fundamentally lazy so push us towards drinks, but eating gives far more pleasure to mind and body. Once you have that down, keep carrot, radish, cucumber, baked beetroot etc. and replace drink urges with those.",

Simply chop up, chuck in and chill out\n\nIf you prefer you can also sauté the onions for 10 minutes first until they begin to soften and go golden, add the garlic, ginger and spices and sauté for a further 2 minutes before adding this and all the other ingredients to the slow cooker\n\n**## VIDEO**\n\n[https://youtu.be/2ioTAhMTW7o](https://youtu.be/2iotahmtw7o)\n\n**## Ingredients ##**\n\n* 60ml Vegetable Oil\n* 750g Brown/White Onion\n* 1 Green Pepper\n* 1 medium Chopped Carrot\n* 1 tablespoon Garlic Paste (or freshly grated)\n* 1 tablespoon Ginger Paste (or freshly grated)\n* 1 tablespoon Coriander Powder\n* 1 tablespoon Cumin Powder\n* 1 tablespoon Turmeric Powder\n* 1 tablespoon Sugar\n* 1 tablespoon Garam Masala Powder\n* 1 teaspoon Salt\n* 1 teaspoon Paprika Powder\n* 400g Plum Tinned Tomatoes\n* 2-3 litres boiling Water\n\n**## Method ##**\n\n1. peel and roughly chop the onions, pepper and carrots and either grate or mince the garlic and ginger\n2. add all the ingredients into the slow cooker along with enough boiling water to cover and stir well.\n3. cook for: 6-8 hours (high) or 10-12 hours (low)\n4. once all the ingredients have softened allow to cool, blend until smooth and then top up with cold water to give your 3 litres where necessary\n5. you can now store in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or freeze in 250ml portions (250ml per dish)\n\nThe standard recipe should produce 3.5 litres of gravy when complete, enough for 14 curries",

So just eat less rice/roti and more dry sabjis (maybe not the potato ones lol, but take your pick of the many other vegetable dishes we have). When made at home most curries tend to be pretty low calorie so you can eat a lot at one go. And they're still very flavourful and tasty. \n\nAlso, dal can be had as a soup basically that should fill you up. 100g uncooked dal (a pretty generous serving) is something like 350 calories. Throw some veg in there (maybe turn it into palak dal) and you'll have a really big bowl of nourishing, low calorie food. Add a slice of bread or something on the side if you'd like.\n\nAlso, I'm sorry, but \n\n> I would love to see this kind of approach applied to indian and other foreign cusines\n\nIf you're an outsider, it's not very nice to come in with preconceived notions that all \"foreign\" food must be unhealthy. Food is a product of local culture and activity levels. Up until quite recently, the majority of Indians led very active lifestyles and so needed the carby food for energy. Many other countries are the same. Things are changing slowly, now that people tend to be more sedentary.

I actually like the flavoured versions, but most of them have added sugar and less protein.\n\nI’m looking for easy, quick ways (preferably under 2 minutes) to improve the taste of plain Greek yogurt without making it unhealthy. No added sugar, and I’d like to keep the high protein content intact.\n\nAny hacks, mix-ins, or go-to combos you use that make it more enjoyable which I can do daily as a vegetarian? Bonus if it doesn’t require a blender or a lot of prep!\n\nps- I found adding vanilla extract as easiest method, haven't tried it yet though. Thoughts?",

What is this plate full of rice and puri with one watery aalu sabji? \n\nThen these people will add loads of cucumber-onion salad and curd and call it a balanced diet. I was surprised to see most people don't realise that puri is not healthy just because it's made at home. \n\nSuch lack of basic knowledge regarding food is astounding. ",

It's easy to cook, never ending up soggy, and from what I've read it has a lot of the nutritional benefits of brown rice. \n\nI'm really surprised that it's not more widely known and consumed in the US. I only know of one place to get it, and had never seen it before. Seems like it should have a wider market share. ",

Add coriander, cumin, turmeric, dry mango powder in your needed quantities and cook for 2 minutes. Add chopped/crushed/pureed tomatoes. Cook until oil separates from tomatoes. Additionally, you can add salt and maybe tomato paste before add raw tomatoes to get a deeper flavour.\n\nYou can add any protein or veggie to the base gravy with water and cook for 5 - 10 minutes as per your protein cooking time.\n\nFinish off with a pinch of garam masala powder at the end.\n\nYou can play around with lentils, poultry meats, eggs, etc.\n\nYou can also skip onions and garlic in the base gravy and substitute with Asafoetida to get the same flavour. Be careful, asafoetida is very strong. Use carefully. Rest of the base gravy remains same.",
